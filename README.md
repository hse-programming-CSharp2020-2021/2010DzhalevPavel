This is the school repository I will be using for my programming classes at Higher School of Economics, Moscow.

Most of the code is written in C#, as this is the primary language used in the class.

#Structure

Tasks are structured in modules and their corresponding seminars during the year. **Homework** can usually be found under the "HW" folder in each of the seminars.

If there are any questions, you can always email me at [pdzhalev@edu.hse.ru](mailto:pdzhalev@edu.hse.ru).
